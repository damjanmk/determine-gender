# determine-gender
Determine the gender of samples in exome and transcriptome sequencing

determine_gender_using_wes.py is a standalone script, which takes a directory of bam files as input  
determine_gender_from_rna-seq.R is just a function, using a read counts dataframe, and part of my [DEA.R](https://github.com/wdecoster/DEA.R) script
